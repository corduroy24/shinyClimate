> shiny app for climate change 



## Purpose of this App:
This app was designed for two reasons:
- provide a family friendly illustration of Canadian climate change - slopes 
- give users a trustworthy look at climate trends in their province, (or city)
- 
  



## Original Data
The original data were produced by [https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/display-download.html]. However, I received it from my Supervisor. Which in turn, sourced from Environment Canada.
As time permitted, only Temperature data was used. Specifically, Second Generation of Homogenized Temperatures for Canada - Update to December 2017. Furthermore, mimimum, maximum and mean monthly temperatures. 
The features included:
- station number 
- city name 
- province 
- monthly, annual, and seasonal temperatures
